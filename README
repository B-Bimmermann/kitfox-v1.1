1. Build Library Models:

    1.1 Build DRAMSim (if used):
        # Download DRAMSim2-2.2.2 (https://github.com/dramninjasUMD/DRAMSim2/archive/v2.2.2.tar.gz)
        # to library/energylib_dramsim/tarball. The KitFox support the 2.2.2
        # version, and other versions were not tested. Go back to the KitFox
        # main directory, and type the following command to build the DRAMSim 
        # and create an archive file.
            $ make dramsim

    1.2 Build DSENT (if used):
        # Download DSENT 0.91 (https://sites.google.com/site/mitdsent/download)
        # to library/energylib_dsent/tarball. The KitFox supports the 0.91 
        # version, and other versions were not tested. Go back to the KitFox 
        # main directory, and type the following command to build the DSENT 
        # and create an archive file.
            $ make dsent
        # DSENT v0.91 has several build errors in native Linux and Mac 
        # environments. Patches files are provided under 
        # library/energylib_dsent/patch to fix the errors by renaming the file
        # names and to create an archive file.
        
    1.3 Build INTSIM (if used):
        # The alpha version (v1.0) of INTSIM is included under 
        # library/energylib_intsim/tarball. This version of INTSIM was 
        # converted from the original MATLAB code (which can also be found; 
        # library/energylib_intsim/tarball/intsim_alpha_version.zip) to C/C++ 
        # code. Type the following command to build the INTSIM and create and 
        # archive file.
            $ make intsim

    1.4 Build McPAT (if used):
        # Download McPAT 0.8 (http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/mcpat0.8_r274.tar.gz)
        # to library/energylib_mcpat/tarball. The KitFox supports the 0.8_r274 
        # version, and other versions were not tested. Go back to the KitFox 
        # main directory, and type the following command to build the McPAT 
        # and create an archive file.
            $ make mcpat
    	# McPAT v0.8 has several (apparent) bugs and errors. Patch files are 
        # provided under library/energylib_mcpat/patch/ to fix those. Please, 
        # expect that some results can be different due to patches. Also, these
        # patches files provide some additional functionalities such as to 
        # support runtime power simulation and dynamic variable update 
        # (i.e., voltage, temperature, etc.).

    1.5 Build 3D-ICE (if used):
        # Download SuperLU-4.3 (http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/superlu_4.3.tar.gz)
        # and 3D-ICE 2.1 (http://esl.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/esl/files/3dice/3d-ice-2.1.zip) 
        # to libary/thermallib_3dice/tarball. The KitFox supports the 2.1 
        # version, and other versions were not tested. Go back to the KitFox 
        # main directory, and type the following command to build SuperLU and 
        # 3D-ICE and create archive files.
        	$ make 3dice
        # Some patch files are provided under library/thermallib_3dice/patch/ 
        # only to fix build and link errors to create an archive file.
        
    1.6 Build HotSpot (if used):
        # Download HotSpot5.02 (http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/HotSpot/grab/HotSpot-5.02.tar.gz)
        # to library/thermallib/hotspot/tarball. The KitFox supports the 5.02 
        # version, and other versions were not tested. Go back to the KitFox 
        # main directory, and type the following command to build the HotSpot 
        # and create an archive file.
        	$ make hotspot
        # Some patch files are provided under library/thermallib_hotspot/patch/ 
        # only to fixe build and link errors when creating an archive file.

    1.7 Build Microfluidics (if used):
        # A tarball is included under library/thermallib_microfluidics/tarball
        # Type the following command to build the microfluidics model.
                $ make microfluidics
            
    1.8 Build Failure (if used):
        # A tarball is included under library/reliabilitylib_failure/tarball
        # Type the following command to build the failure model.
        	$ make failure

    # NOTE: In each library model, there is a tarball directory which includes 
    # downloaded copy(ies) from the original developers' website. In case that 
    # there is a problem with downloading the specified version of model, the 
    # included tarball may be used to build it, but we do not guarantee this is
    # the same copy as the original developers' release nor possess any 
    # copyrights or responsibilities of using it. All terms and conditions are 
    # subject to what the original developers present.


2. Build KitFox:
    # After models are compiled, type the following command to build the KitFox.
        $ make
    # This command will create a libKitFox.a archive file that can be linked 
    # to a simulator with "-lKitFox -L(KITFOX_DIRECTORY_PATH)" flags with the 
    # flags with built models.
        # to use DRAMSim, include "-ldramsim"
        # to use DSENT, include "-ldsent"
        # to use INTSIM, include "-lintsim"
        # to use McPAT, include "-lmcpat"
        # to use 3D-ICE, include "-l3dice"
        # to use HotSpot, include "-lhotspot"
        # to use Microfluidics, include "-lmicrofluidics"
        # to use Failure, include "-lfailure"
    # Also include "-I(KITFOX_DIRECTORY_PATH) 
    # -I(KITFOX_DIRECTORY_PATH)/communicator" flags when compiling the 
    # simulator with "include "kitfox.h"
